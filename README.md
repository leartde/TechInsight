## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get TechInsight up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/leartde/TechInsight.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Client Directory**: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the `TechInsightClient` directory. This is where the client-side code of the application resides. Use the following command to navigate to this directory:

    ```bash
    cd TechInsight/TechInsightClient
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**: The next step is to install the necessary dependencies for the client-side of the application. We use npm (Node Package Manager) to manage these dependencies. Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the client-side server**: After installing the dependencies, you can start the client-side server. This server will host the front-end of the application. Use the following command to start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command will start the server and open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

5. **Update the database**: Before starting the API, make sure to update the database. This step is crucial to ensure that the API can communicate with the database correctly. If you're using Entity Framework migrations, you can update the database using the following command in the Package Manager Console:

    ```bash
    Update-database
    ```

    This command will apply any pending migrations to the database. If you're not using migrations, you'll need to manually update the database schema to match the models in the application.

After following these steps, you should have TechInsight running on your local machine. Enjoy exploring and contributing to the platform!
